# Employee Payroll Tracker Starter Code

For this project I modified starter code to create an application that allows a payroll manager to view and manage employee payroll data. This application uses HTML, CSS and Java script. It will allow managers to properly budget for the company based on the employees payroll data.

# How it works:

Click the "Add employee" button
You will then be presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary.
Once you are finish adding an employee.
You will be prompted to continue or cancel.
If you choose to continue you will be prompted to add a new employee.
Choose to cancel for employee data to be displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data.
